# wp-custom-post-types

Sometimes we just need a simple little 'fix' to present things in wordpress.
Don't want to install woocommerce ?
Want something dyanmic but lightweight ?

Use this base to create custom 'post types' for your wordpress template. 
Simply adjust to suit and drop it in your plugins folder.

Create things like 
- Courses
- Events
- Products
- Team Databases
- Real Estate Listing

Use in conjunction with Advanced Custom Fields and you can create your own complex Post Types

Map the custom terms with your page builder like Elementor or WPbakery
